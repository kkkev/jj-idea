{"id":"jj-idea-dtc","title":"Render refs/bookmarks with platform-style icons instead of colored text","description":"Replace the current colored text rendering of refs/bookmarks with fancy icons matching the platform's default Commit column appearance.\n\n## Current Implementation\n\nCustom Description column renders refs as colored text:\n- Bold, smaller font\n- Color from `VcsRef.type.backgroundColor`\n- Functional but less polished than platform's version\n\nExample: `description text  bookmark1 tag1 @`\n\n## Platform's Approach\n\nDefault Commit column uses sophisticated icon-based rendering:\n- **Bookmarks**: Small golden bookmark icon (path-based shape)\n- **Tags**: Colored rounded rectangles with tag name\n- **References**: Colored labels with ref type colors\n- **Compact mode**: Icons only, no text\n- **Tooltips**: Hover shows full ref details\n\n## Why This Is Hard\n\nAll icon rendering infrastructure is **internal-only**:\n\n### 1. VcsLogLabelPainter (internal)\nFrom `platform/vcs-log/impl/src/com/intellij/vcs/log/ui/render/VcsLogLabelPainter.kt`:\n```kotlin\ninternal class VcsLogLabelPainter(\n    private val logData: VcsLogData, \n    component: JComponent, \n    iconCache: LabelIconCache\n) : LabelPainter(component, iconCache) {\n    fun customizePainter(\n        references: Collection\u003cVcsRef\u003e,\n        bookmarks: Collection\u003cVcsBookmarkRef\u003e,\n        // ...\n    )\n}\n```\n\n### 2. BookmarkIcon (internal)\nFrom `platform/vcs-log/impl/src/com/intellij/vcs/log/ui/render/BookmarkIcon.java`:\n```java\npublic class BookmarkIcon implements Icon {\n  private final Color BOOKMARK_REF_TYPE_COLOR = \n      JBColor.namedColor(\"VersionControl.RefLabel.bookmarkBackground\",\n                         new JBColor(0xf4af3d, 0xd9a343));\n  \n  @Override\n  public void paintIcon(Component c, Graphics g, int iconX, int iconY) {\n    // Draws bookmark path shape\n    Path2D.Float path = new Path2D.Float();\n    path.moveTo(x, y);\n    // ... bookmark shape\n    g2.fill(path);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. LabelPainter (internal)\nFrom `platform/vcs-log/impl/src/com/intellij/vcs/log/ui/render/LabelPainter.java`:\n- Manages icon positioning and sizing\n- Handles compact vs. expanded mode\n- Calculates available width and truncation\n- All methods are `internal` or package-private\n\n### 4. LabelIcon (internal)\nRenders colored rounded rectangles for ref labels.\n\n## Possible Approaches (without custom log pane)\n\n### 1. Copy/Reimplement Icons (high effort)\n- Copy `BookmarkIcon`, `LabelIcon` source code\n- Reimplement `LabelPainter` logic\n- Maintain as platform updates\n- **Risk**: Legal/licensing concerns, high maintenance\n\n### 2. Reflection Access (fragile)\n```kotlin\n// Try to instantiate internal classes via reflection\nval painterClass = Class.forName(\"com.intellij.vcs.log.ui.render.VcsLogLabelPainter\")\n// Very fragile, breaks with obfuscation/changes\n```\n\n### 3. Custom Icons (medium effort)\n- Create our own bookmark/tag icon implementations\n- Won't match platform exactly but close approximation\n- Reasonable approach if custom log pane not pursued\n\n## Proper Solution\n\n**Requires custom VCS log pane** (see epic jj-idea-gyo):\n- Implement custom renderer with access to internal classes\n- Can use reflection or direct instantiation in custom UI\n- Full control over rendering pipeline\n- Can match platform appearance exactly\n\n## Visual Comparison\n\n**Current (colored text)**:\n```\nFix bug in parser  main trunk @\n```\n\n**Desired (with icons)**:\n```\nFix bug in parser  [📌 main] [📦 trunk] [@]\n```\n(where [📌] is golden bookmark icon, [📦] is colored rounded label, etc.)\n\n## Investigation References\n\nPlatform files studied:\n- `platform/vcs-log/impl/src/com/intellij/vcs/log/ui/render/VcsLogLabelPainter.kt`\n- `platform/vcs-log/impl/src/com/intellij/vcs/log/ui/render/BookmarkIcon.java`\n- `platform/vcs-log/impl/src/com/intellij/vcs/log/ui/render/LabelPainter.java`\n- `platform/vcs-log/impl/src/com/intellij/vcs/log/ui/render/LabelIcon.java`\n- `platform/vcs-log/impl/src/com/intellij/vcs/log/ui/render/GraphCommitCellRenderer.kt`\n\n## Dependency\nBlocked by jj-idea-gyo (Custom VCS log pane implementation)\n\n## Priority\nP2 - Nice to have, current colored text is functional","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-18T18:44:17.023107Z","updated_at":"2025-12-24T20:47:14.277596Z","closed_at":"2025-12-24T20:47:14.277596Z","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"jj-idea-dtc","depends_on_id":"jj-idea-gyo","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-18T18:44:23.90187Z","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"jj-idea-dtc","depends_on_id":"jj-idea-cc6","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-21T18:56:15.728277Z","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"jj-idea-gyo","title":"[Epic] Custom VCS log pane implementation","description":"# Custom VCS Log Pane Implementation\n\nReplace IntelliJ's default VCS log UI with a custom implementation to enable deep customization of the log view that's not possible with the current public API.\n\n## Why Custom Implementation Needed\n\nThe IntelliJ VCS log framework has several limitations for plugins:\n\n1. **Fixed default columns**: `Root` and `Commit` columns are hardcoded and cannot be hidden or reordered\n2. **No column visibility control**: No public API to programmatically set column visibility (all column management APIs are `internal`)\n3. **Limited rendering customization**: Cannot use platform's internal rendering infrastructure (`VcsLogLabelPainter`, `BookmarkIcon`, etc.)\n4. **Column ordering restrictions**: Custom columns always appear after fixed platform columns\n\n## Investigation Findings\n\n### API Research (2025-12-21)\n\n**VCS Log Tab Creation APIs**:\n- `VcsLogContentUtil.openLogTab()` - Exists but requires already-created VcsLogUi\n- `VcsLogManager.getInstance()`, `createLogUi()` - Not available in public SDK\n- `VcsLogManager.openNewLogTab()` - Used internally by platform, not exposed\n- Most tab creation methods are in internal classes not accessible to plugins\n\n**Working Prototype Created**:\n- Service: `JujutsuCustomLogTabManager`\n- Action: `OpenJujutsuLogTabAction`\n- Currently opens standard VCS log (uses our custom columns via extension points)\n- Files: `src/main/kotlin/in/kkkev/jjidea/ui/JujutsuCustomLogTabManager.kt`\n\n**Limitations with Standard Approach**:\n- ✅ Custom columns work (Status, Change ID, Description, Committer)\n- ❌ Default columns (Root, Commit) cannot be hidden\n- ❌ Cannot control column ordering\n- ❌ Cannot access internal rendering APIs\n\n### Implementation Approach - Path B (Full Custom)\n\n**Decision**: Proceed with full custom VcsLogUi implementation despite complexity\n\n**Strategy**:\n1. Study IntelliJ platform source for VcsLogUi patterns\n2. Create custom VcsLogUiFactory implementation\n3. Build custom table model and column manager\n4. Use reflection or code copying to access internal rendering APIs\n5. Manage lifecycle properly to avoid memory leaks\n\n**Key Platform Classes to Study**:\n- `VcsLogUiImpl` - Main log UI implementation\n- `VcsLogGraphTable` - Table component\n- `GraphTableModel` - Table data model\n- `VcsLogColumnManager` - Column management (internal)\n- `VcsLogLabelPainter`, `BookmarkIcon` - Rendering (internal)\n\n## What Custom Implementation Would Enable\n\n1. **Complete column control**:\n   - Hide or replace default Commit column\n   - Position custom columns first\n   - Programmatic column visibility defaults\n\n2. **Advanced rendering**:\n   - Use platform's label painters and icons\n   - Custom graph rendering\n   - Right-aligned refs in description column\n\n3. **Custom UI/UX**:\n   - Different table layout\n   - Custom row rendering\n   - Additional UI controls\n\n## Dependent Tasks\n\nTasks that require custom log pane:\n- jj-idea-dtc: Render refs/bookmarks with platform-style icons\n- jj-idea-n0o: Right-align references in Description column\n- jj-idea-u4g: Replace/hide default Commit column\n\n## Complexity Assessment\n\n**Very High** - This is a significant undertaking:\n- Need to understand and replicate substantial platform VCS log infrastructure\n- Requires reflection or code copying to access internal APIs\n- Maintenance burden as platform evolves\n- Risk of breaking with platform updates\n\n**Mitigation**:\n- Start with basic feature parity\n- Isolate internal API usage for easier updates\n- Comprehensive testing\n- Document all assumptions and workarounds\n\n## Priority\n\nP2 - High priority.

{"id":"jj-idea-x6m","title":"Investigate VCS log internal API accessibility and alternatives","description":"## Investigation: Option B - Fully Custom Log UI\n\n**Decision**: Build completely custom table/graph UI from scratch, no VcsLogUiEx dependency.\n\n## Architecture: Standalone Custom Log UI\n\n### Core Principle\nDon't extend IntelliJ's VcsLogUi at all. Build our own UI that:\n- Uses our JujutsuLogProvider data directly\n- Has its own table component\n- Renders its own commit graph\n- Lives in our own tool window tab\n\n### Components to Build\n\n#### 1. Data Layer (Reuse existing)\n✅ Already have:\n- JujutsuLogProvider - provides commits\n- LogService - gets log entries\n- ChangeId, LogEntry - domain types\n\n#### 2. Table Component (Build from scratch)\n**JujutsuLogTable** - Custom JTable\n- Extends JTable directly (not VcsLogGraphTable)\n- Custom TableModel with our columns\n- No dependency on GraphTableModel\n- Columns:\n  - Graph (visual commit graph)\n  - Status (conflict/empty icons)\n  - Change ID (formatted)\n  - Description (with right-aligned refs)\n  - Author\n  - Date\n\n#### 3. Graph Rendering (Build custom)\n**JujutsuCommitGraphRenderer** - Custom cell renderer\n- Draw commit graph using Graphics2D\n- Circles for commits\n- Lines for parent relationships\n- Different colors for branches\n- Similar to VcsLogGraphTable but simpler\n\n#### 4. Column Renderers (Custom implementations)\n- **GraphCellRenderer** - Draws commit graph\n- **StatusCellRenderer** - Conflict/empty icons\n- **ChangeIdCellRenderer** - Bold prefix + gray remainder\n- **DescriptionCellRenderer** - Description + right-aligned bookmark icons\n- **AuthorCellRenderer** - Author name\n- **DateCellRenderer** - Relative dates\n\n#### 5. Main Panel (Custom layout)\n**JujutsuLogPanel** - Main UI component\n- JujutsuLogTable in scroll pane\n- Toolbar (refresh, filters)\n- Details pane (commit info when selected)\n- Status bar (commit count, etc.)\n\n#### 6. Data Loading (Custom)\n**JujutsuLogDataLoader** - Background loading\n- Load commits from JujutsuLogProvider\n- Build graph structure from parent relationships\n- Update table model on EDT\n- Handle pagination/incremental loading\n\n### Integration Points\n\n**Instead of VcsLogUi registration**:\n- Add tab to our existing 'Working copy' tool window\n- Or create new 'Jujutsu' tool window with multiple tabs\n- Use ContentFactory to create tabs\n\n**Data source**:\n- JujutsuLogProvider (already works)\n- Call logService.getLog() directly\n- No dependency on VcsLogData/VcsLogManager\n\n**Actions**:\n- Right-click context menu with our own actions\n- Double-click to show diff\n- Keyboard shortcuts (F4, Enter, etc.)\n\n## Advantages of This Approach\n\n1. **No internal API dependencies** - Only use public IntelliJ SDK\n2. **Complete control** - Every pixel is ours\n3. **Simpler codebase** - No fighting with platform abstractions\n4. **Jujutsu-native** - Design specifically for JJ concepts\n5. **Easier to maintain** - No platform update breakage\n6. **Faster iteration** - No reverse-engineering platform behavior\n\n## Challenges\n\n1. **Graph algorithm** - Need to implement commit graph layout\n2. **Performance** - Optimize for large repos (1000+ commits)\n3. **Polish** - Match platform look \u0026 feel\n4. **Features** - Implement filtering, search, etc.\n5. **Effort** - More code to write upfront\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Basic Table (jj-idea-9to, jj-idea-jbb, jj-idea-57u)\n- JujutsuLogTable with basic columns (no graph yet)\n- Simple TableModel loading from LogService\n- Basic rendering (text only)\n- Show in tool window tab\n**Goal**: See commits in a table\n\n### Phase 2: Graph Rendering (new task)\n- Implement commit graph layout algorithm\n- GraphCellRenderer with Graphics2D\n- Parent relationship visualization\n**Goal**: Visual commit graph\n\n### Phase 3: Custom Renderers (jj-idea-53v, jj-idea-aq7)\n- All column-specific renderers\n- Icons, colors, formatting\n- Right-aligned refs in description\n**Goal**: Professional appearance\n\n### Phase 4: Features (jj-idea-9y2, jj-idea-ncg, jj-idea-6gx)\n- Details pane\n- Filtering/search\n- Context menu actions\n**Goal**: Feature parity with needs\n\n### Phase 5: Polish (jj-idea-qvf, jj-idea-035)\n- Performance optimization\n- Keyboard shortcuts\n- Testing\n**Goal**: Production ready\n\n## References for Graph Algorithm\n\n- Git log --graph implementation\n- Gitk graph rendering\n- IntelliJ's graph (for inspiration, not code reuse)\n\n## Decision: Proceed with Option B\n\nThis is more work upfront but gives us a maintainable, Jujutsu-native solution.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-21T20:55:29.51476Z","updated_at":"2025-12-21T21:01:44.69959Z","closed_at":"2025-12-21T21:01:44.69959Z"}
